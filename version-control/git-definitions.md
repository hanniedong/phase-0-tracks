# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful? Version control keeps tracks of chanages made to a project over time. It allows people to view the entire history of revisions made it o files and merge revisions made my different people. Version control essentially makes it easy for developors to collaborate and share work with others. 

* What is a branch and why would you use one? A branch is a "copy" of the project. Branching allows users to experiment with different versions of a project by checking out separate branches to work on.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message? . A commit permanently stores changes from the staging area inside the repository and is essentially a save point for the project. A good commit message is detailed and documents the changes made since hte last commit.

* What is a merge conflict? Merge conflicts may occur if changes are made to the same line of a file. It happens when commits are made on separate branches that alter the same line in conflicting ways.
