DIRECTIONS
One user can enter a word (or phrase, if you would like your game to support that), and another user attempts to guess the word.
Guesses are limited, and the number of guesses available is related to the length of the word.
Repeated guesses do not count against the user.
The guessing player receives continual feedback on the current state of the word. So if the secret word is "unicorn", the user will start out seeing something like "_ _ _ _ _ _ _", which would become "_ _ _ c _ _ _" after the user enters a guess of "c".
The user should get a congratulatory message if they win, and a taunting message if they lose.



#WINNING OR LOSING
#If user wins, send congratulatory message
#if user loses, send taunting message
