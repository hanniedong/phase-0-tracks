INSTRUCTIONS
Swap the first and last name.
Changing all of the vowels (a, e, i, o, or u) to the next vowel in 'aeiou', and all of the consonants (everything else besides the vowels) to the next consonant in the alphabet. So 'a' would become 'e', 'u' would become 'a', and 'd' would become 'f'.

When will it be helpful to convert the string to an array to work with it more easily?
How will you figure out whether a letter is a vowel?
How will you deal with the fact that some letters are uppercase?
How will you handle edge cases?

PSEUDOCODE
Ask for user to input name
Swap the name
