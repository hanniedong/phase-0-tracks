What is the difference between a GET request and a POST request? When might each be used?
POST requests supply additional data from the client (browser) to the server in the message body and is used to insert/update remote data. In contrast, GET requests a representation of the specified resource and is used to retrive remote data. With a GET method, you are sending your data via the URL. While, with A POST method, data is embedded in the form object and sent directly from your browser to the server.

Optional bonus question: What is a cookie (the technical kind, not the delicious kind)? How does it relate to HTTP requests?
An HTTP cookie is a small piece of data sent from a website and stored on the user's computer by the user's web browser while the user is browsing. Cookies were designed to be a reliable mechanism for websites to remember stateful information.
