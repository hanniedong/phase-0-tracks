In your own words, what is a VPS (virtual private server)? What, according to your research, are the advantages of using a VPS?
A virtual private server (VPS) is a virtual machine sold as a service by an Internet hosting service. A VPS runs its own copy of an operating system, and customers may have access to that operating system instance, so they can install almost any software that runs on that OS. As you don't share your OS with anyone else, there are no other websites on your server that potentially have access to your files.  With a VPS Server, you have your own Operating System. If you need to have any services customized, you can make changes to suit the server to your needs. On a VPS Server, you have dedicated amounts of RAM available to you at any time. Unlike shared hosting, there is no one else on your server that can use utilize all the RAM when you need it.

Optional bonus question: Why is it considered a bad idea to run programs as the root user on a Linux system
It defeats the security model. Applications are meant to be run with non-administrative security.
