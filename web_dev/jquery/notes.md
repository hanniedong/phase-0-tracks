STUDY PLAN

-find three good websites about JQuery 
    -this will allow me to gain a better understanding of JQuery 
-Use Codeacademy to practice syntax
-take breaks to practice what has been learned after every sub topic

I found that doing exercises and seeing how the different code have different effects was most effective to my learning. It's one thing to understand the code, but another to actually apply it.
